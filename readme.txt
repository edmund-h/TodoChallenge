~ I had a ton of fun doing this challenge! I woke up as early as I could to start doing it and now Iâ€™m ready to pass out!
~ In the initial screen, double tap outside the collection view item to make a new todo or filter them.
~ Did not manage to get Editing/Deleting/Marking as Done done but if I did:
	*Editing would be done from the same VC as add new, with an extra mark done button
	*Marking done and deleting could be done from a popover menu in the list VC
~ Thanks so much for your consideration and I hope to hear from you soon!
